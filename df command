NAME
       df - report file system space usage

SYNOPSIS
       df [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       This  manual  page documents the GNU version of df.  df displays the amount of space available on the file system containing each file name argument.  If no
       file name is given, the space available on all currently mounted file systems is shown.  Space is shown in 1K blocks  by  default,  unless  the  environment
       variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.

       If  an argument is the absolute file name of a device node containing a mounted file system, df shows the space available on that file system rather than on
       the file system containing the device node.  This version of df cannot show the space available on unmounted file systems, because on most kinds of  systems
       doing so requires non-portable intimate knowledge of file system structures.

OPTIONS
       Show information about the file system on which each FILE resides, or all file systems by default.

       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

       -a, --all
              include pseudo, duplicate, inaccessible file systems

       -B, --block-size=SIZE
              scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g., '-BM' prints sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes; see SIZE format below

       -h, --human-readable
              print sizes in powers of 1024 (e.g., 1023M)

       -H, --si
              print sizes in powers of 1000 (e.g., 1.1G)

       -i, --inodes
              list inode information instead of block usage

       -k     like --block-size=1K

       -l, --local
              limit listing to local file systems

       --no-sync
            do not invoke sync before getting usage info (default)

       --output[=FIELD_LIST]
              use the output format defined by FIELD_LIST, or print all fields if FIELD_LIST is omitted.

       -P, --portability
              use the POSIX output format

       --sync invoke sync before getting usage info

       --total
              elide all entries insignificant to available space, and produce a grand total

       -t, --type=TYPE
              limit listing to file systems of type TYPE

       -T, --print-type
              print file system type

       -x, --exclude-type=TYPE
              limit listing to file systems not of type TYPE

       -v     (ignored)

       --help display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit

       Display  values  are  in units of the first available SIZE from --block-size, and the DF_BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE and BLOCKSIZE environment variables.  Other‐
       wise, units default to 1024 bytes (or 512 if POSIXLY_CORRECT is set).

       The SIZE argument is an integer and optional unit (example: 10K is 10*1024).  Units are K,M,G,T,P,E,Z,Y,R,Q (powers of 1024) or KB,MB,... (powers of  1000).
       Binary prefixes can be used, too: KiB=K, MiB=M, and so on.

       FIELD_LIST  is  a comma-separated list of columns to be included.  Valid field names are: 'source', 'fstype', 'itotal', 'iused', 'iavail', 'ipcent', 'size',
       'used', 'avail', 'pcent', 'file' and 'target' (see info page).
